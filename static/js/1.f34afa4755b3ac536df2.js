It aims at finding the same person as the query image from a large volume of gallery images. With the progress in deep learning, person re-identification has been largely advanced in recent years. However, when generalization ability becomes an important concern, required by practical applications, existing methods usually lack satisfactory performance. To address this, many transfer learning, domain adaptation, and unsupervised learning methods, performed on the target domain, have been proposed. However, these methods require heavy computations in deployment, limiting their application in practical scenarios where the deployment machine may have limited resources to support deep learning and users may cannot wait for a time-consuming adaptation stage. Therefore, improving the baseline model’s generalization ability to support ready-to-use solutions is still of urgent importance.")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("In this tutorial, we will introduce the topic of generalizable person re-identification, from current challenges, the methods we have proposed, the effectiveness of large-scale synthesized dataset for generalizable person re-identification, to the reliability of using synthetic dataset for benchmarking generalizable person re-identification.")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[n("b",[e._v("2.
